--Here is a DB that has employees, customers, invoices, etc data from a Music Sales group
--I will be finding some information regarding the employees, customers, invoices, and etc.




--#1 Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US
SELECT FirstName, CustomerID, Country from Customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';



--#2 Showing only the Customers from Brazil
SELECT * from Customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';



--#3 Showing the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country
SELECT c.FirstName, c.Lastname, i.InvoiceID, I.InvoiceDate, I.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices I

LEFT JOIN chinook.customers C
ON i.customerid = C.CustomerID
WHERE i.billingcountry = 'Brazil';



--#4 Showing the Employees who are Sales Agents
