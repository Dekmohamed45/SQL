--Here is a DB that has employees, customers, invoices, etc data from a Music Sales group
--I will be finding some information regarding the employees, customers, invoices, and etc.


--#1 Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US
SELECT FirstName, CustomerID, Country from Customers
WHERE Country <> 'USA';



--#2 Showing only the Customers from Brazil
SELECT * from Customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';


--#3 Showing the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country
SELECT c.FirstName, c.Lastname, i.InvoiceID, I.InvoiceDate, I.BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices I

LEFT JOIN chinook.customers C
ON i.customerid = C.CustomerID
WHERE i.billingcountry = 'Brazil';


--#4 Showing the Employees who are Sales Agents
SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title LIKE 'Sales%Agent';



--#5 Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table
SELECT distinct billingCountry FROM Chinook.invoices;


--#6 writing this query to show the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name. This requires JOIN from 3 different tables
SELECT * FROM Chinook.Employees;
SELECT * FROM Customers;
SELECT * FROM Invoices;

SELECT e.FIRSTNAME, e.LastName, I.invoiceID
FROM chinook.employees E

JOIN chinook.customers C ON  c.SupportRepID = E.employeeID
JOIN chinook.invoices I ON I.customerID = C.CustomerID;


--# 7 Showing the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers
SELECT * FROM Chinook.Employees;
SELECT * FROM Customers;
SELECT * FROM Invoices;

SELECT C.FirstName, C.LastName, C.Country, E.FirstName, E.LastName,  I.Total
FROM Chinook.invoices I
JOIN Chinook.customers C  ON I.customerID = C.CustomerID
JOIN Chinook.employees E  ON C.SupportRepID = E.EmployeeID;


--#8 How many Invoices there in 2009
SELECT Count(*) FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE '%2009%';

-- Another way to do the answer the above question is using the "Between" command
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


--#9 Total sales in 2009
SELECT Sum(total) AS Total_sales_2019 FROM Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';


--#10 Writing a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID
