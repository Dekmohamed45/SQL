#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.customers
WHERE length(order_id) = 6
AND order_id <> 'Order ID';


--Selecting the table for ease
SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

#1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID)  FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)= 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'; 


#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone'
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';



#3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers Cus

INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
ON Cus.Order_ID = Feb.orderID 
WHERE length(orderID)= 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID';

SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.FebSales;


#4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT distinct product, MIN(price)
FROM  BIT_DB.JanSales;

---I can also do it this way as well
SELECT distinct Product, price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE  price in (SELECT min(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);


#5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT product AS Production, Sum(Quantity)* price AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)= 6
AND orderID <> 'Order ID'
GROUP BY product;


#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product, Location, Sum(Quantity), Sum(Quantity)* price AS total_revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
WHERE LOCATION = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101'
GROUP BY Product;


#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT 
count(distinct cust.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers cust
